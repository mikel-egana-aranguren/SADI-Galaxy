    <ns1:gene-function>"Alpha-2-macroglobulin is, like alpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-2-antiplasmin, and antithrombin III, a protease inhibitor. It inhibits many proteases, including trypsin, thrombin, and collagenase ({3:Bergqvist and Nilsson, 1979}).

{17:Mantuano et al. (2008)} used isolated recombinant human A2M protein fragments, which they called FP3 and FP6, to characterize the cellular functions of specific A2M domains. FP3 contains residues 591 to 774 of A2M and includes the growth factor carrier sites, and FP6 contains residues 1242 to 1451 of A2M and includes the LRP1 ({107770}) recognition domain. FP6 rapidly and robustly activated Akt (see {164730}) and Erk/MAP kinases (see {176948}) in cultured rat Schwann cells and PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells. FP6 also promoted neurite outgrowth and expression of Gap43 ({162060}). These cell signaling events were mediated by Lrp1 and depended on 2 lysines in FP6 that were required for Lrp1 binding. The ability of FP6 to trigger Lrp1-dependent cell signaling in PC12 cells was reproduced by a purified 18-kD fragment of human plasma A2M that included the LRP1 recognition domain. FP3 alone did not induce cell signaling in rat Schwann and PC12 cells, but it blocked Ngf-beta (NGFB; {162030})-induced activation of Akt and Erk/MAP kinases. FP3 did not block activation of cell signaling induced by FP6.

Using mass spectrometry, {22:Peslova et al. (2009)} showed that hepcidin (HAMP; {606464}) in human plasma or serum was bound by albumin (ALB; {103600}) and by A2M. Binding of hepcidin to albumin was nonspecific and displayed nonsaturable kinetics. However, binding of hepcidin to A2M was specific. Scatchard analysis estimated 2 hepcidin-binding sites per inactive A2M molecule. Proteolytic activation of A2M resulted in a sigmoidal binding curve, suggesting high-affinity cooperative allosteric binding of 4 hepcidin molecules per active A2M molecule. The hepcidin-A2M complex, but not the hepcidin-albumin complex, decreased ferroportin (SLC40A1; {604653}) expression in J774 murine macrophages more effectively than hepcidin alone. {22:Peslova et al. (2009)} hypothesized that A2M has a role in regulating hepcidin action by sequestration and subsequent release."^^&lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string&gt;</ns1:gene-function>

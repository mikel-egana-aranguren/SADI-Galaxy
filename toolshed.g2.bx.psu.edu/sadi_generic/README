ABOUT
=====

This is a client for SADI services. A SADI service consumes and ouputs
RDF. Therefore, if you provide the service URI and a correct RDF input, 
this client will infer if the RDF is really compliant with the service 
and submit it, obtaining the output RDF (Another tool, RDFSyntaxConverter,
is included to convert RDF to tab delimited files and other RDF syntaxes).

This client is part of a larger project that provides SADI services as 
Galaxy tools, SADI-Galaxy.
